## **Gitflow Workflow**

Gitflow is a branching model for managing workflows in Git. Here's how you can use it in this project:

### **1. Main Branches**
- **`main`**: The production-ready branch. Always stable.
- **`develop`**: The branch for ongoing development.

### **2. Feature Branches**
- Create a new branch for each feature or task:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
  ```
- Work on your feature and commit changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add <feature-name>"
  ```
- Push the feature branch to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<feature-name>
  ```
- Merge the feature branch into `develop` when done:
  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  git merge feature/<feature-name>
  ```

### **3. Release Branches**
- When `develop` is ready for a release, create a release branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b release/<version>
  ```
- Merge the release branch into `main` and tag the release:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge release/<version>
  git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
  ```

### **4. Hotfix Branches**
- For urgent fixes, create a hotfix branch from `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b hotfix/<hotfix-name>
  ```
- Merge the hotfix into `main` and `develop`:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge hotfix/<hotfix-name>
  git checkout develop
  git merge hotfix/<hotfix-name>
  ```
